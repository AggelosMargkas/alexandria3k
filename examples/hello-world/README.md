# Minimal application

This is an example of a minimal _Alexandria3k_ application.
It populates a database with work titles and abstracts from
a random sample specified to comprise about 0.02% of the Crossref containers.
It then creates a report on the number of works containing `hello` or `world`
in their title or abstract.
